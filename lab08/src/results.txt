Inserting 10,000 length 2 random strings:
* ULLMap: 0.03s
* MyHashMap: 0.01s
* java.util.HashMap: 0.00s

Inserting 10,000 ordered strings:
* ULLMap: 0.36s
* MyHashMap: 0.03s
* java.util.HashMap: 0.01s

Although java.util.HashMap and MyHashMap are implemented with similar ideas in mind, java.util.HashMap is consistently faster.
There must have been special optimizations in java.util.HashMap.

Inserting 10,000 strings with different buckets:
* ArrayList: 0.02s
* LinkedList: 0.01s
* HashSet: 0.02s
* Stack: 0.02s
* ArrayDeque: 0.01s
